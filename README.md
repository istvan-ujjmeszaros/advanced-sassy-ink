# Advanced Sassy Ink

> Responsive email framework and style inliner with great email client compatibility, based on Ink<br>
> A fine-tuned version of the great [Sassy Ink](https://github.com/faustgertz/sassy-ink) fork from [@faustgertz](https://github.com/faustgertz), based on [Foundation for Emails (formerly Ink)](http://foundation.zurb.com/emails.html).

## Features

The project has a `gulpfile.js`, which contains tasks for compiling the css file from sass, and for moving the css styles inline in the provided html email templates.

The compiled html files are optimized to work in every email client, for example it capitalizes the `Margin` and `Float` styles so [they will work on outlook.com](https://www.emailonacid.com/blog/article/email-development/outlook.com-does-support-margins).

## HTML email best practices

To achieve the best possible email client support, you need to know about some surprising pitfalls in some email clients out there. There is a great [CSS Support Guide on Campaign Monitor's website](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/).
I stress out that `padding` is not supported on `<p>`, `<div>` and `<a>` tags, and `width` is not supported on `<p>` and `<div>` elements.

If you avoid those pitfalls, then you can achieve pretty great compatibility.

## Changes compared to the original version

The original documentation at http://zurb.com/ink/docs.php is applicable in most parts.

### Prefer block-grid instead of grid

The main difference is that the grid columns are reduced to only two by default, as they does not play well with Gmail which has no support for media queries, so shows all the columns in one row even on very small screens.

That's why it is reduced to only two columns, so it is only good for having support to use a left aligned section and a right aligned section in the same row.

In every other use cases it is recommended to use the block-column syntax instead, which is responsive even on Gmail.

### Removed the buttons

Ink's button styles are not user friendly as they look as a button, but only the text is clickable, not the whole "button"", which can confuse the readers.

The recommended way is to use Campaign Monitor's [Bulletproof email buttons](http://buttons.cm/) generator, which generates two different button versions, which works great in every email client.

## Customizing the sass build

> You can compile the default ink.scss file without doing any modifications.

If you want to customize the sass files, then you need to create a new `_settings.scss` file inside the `scss/ink/` folder, based on `_settings-default.scss`, which is there only for reference. That file contains all the variables that can be customized, just find those you need, uncomment them and change their value.

## Compiling the production ready HTML email

For the best possible compatibility, HTML emails need to utilize inline styles instead of the style header.

This project contains a gulp file with tasks to do that automatically.

### How gulp works

If you are not familiar with Gulp, no fear, it is fairly easy to setup.

You need to install node.js, which you can obtain at [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/).<br>
Then run `npm install` from the command line in the project's root folder, which will install all the required node modules.<br>
After that, you can compile both the sass files and the html templates by running `gulp` from the command line in the project root.

## Compatibility

The compiled html template will have the best possible email client compatibility, tested with Litmus on a layout that utilizes the two column grid and three columns of the block-grid.
